# New York Citi Bike

### Background

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.  The task in this project is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find unexpected phenomena.  The time period of January - July 2020 was chosen to evauate how the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic affected bike usage.

  1.  How has the user type (customer or annual subscriber) changed over time?
  2.  What are the riding habits of males vs females?
  3.  How has the data changed across age groups?
  4.  What are the locations of the most popular stations?
